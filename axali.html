    <p>
        It is a long established fact that a reader will be<br>
         distracted by the readable content of a page when<br>
          looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum<br>
           is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of<br>
            letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content<br>
             here', making it look like readable English. Many<br>
              desktop publishing packages and web page editors<br>
               now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text,<br>
                and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many<br>
                 web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have<br>
                  evolved over the years, sometimes by accident,<br>
                   sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the<br>
                    like).
